Code for a monitoring and feedback system for spark-ignited gas generator sets (gensets) is to be implemented which would monitor parameters such as lubricant oil pressure, coolant temperature, exhaust gas temperature, genset battery voltage, engine R.P.M., etc., by taking them as inputs over CAN bus from Engine Control Modules (E.C.M.s) or separately from individual sensors, and display them to the user on an L.C.D. In case of any abnormalities sensed in these parameters, a warning signal is to be sent, or shut down (fuel shut off) action is to be performed, depending upon the severity.
